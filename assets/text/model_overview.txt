## OVERVIEW OF DATA USED/ FEATURES ENGINEERED


#### TWITTER DATA - CLASSIFICATION MODEL
**Trained Word2Vec embeddings on collection of Donal Trump's Tweets.**
- Used negative skip-gram method and negative sampling to best represent infrequently used words.
    
**Classified tweets based on change in stock price (delta_price)**
- Calculated price change from time of tweet to 60 mins later.
    - "No Change" if the delta price was < \\$0.05 
    - "Increase" if delta price was >+\\$0.05
    - "Decrease if delta price was >-\\$0.05
    
*NOTE: This model's predictions will become a feature in our final model.*

#### STOCK MARKET (S&P 500) DATA :
##### TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING MARKET DATA
**Model 1: Use price alone to forecast hourly price.**
- Train model using time sequences of 7-trading-hours (1 day) to predict the following hour. 
    * [x] ~~SARIMAX model~~
    * [x] LSTM neural network 

**Model 2: Use price combined with technical indicators.**
- **Calculate 7 technical indicators from S&P 500 hourly closing price.**
    * [x] 7 days moving average 
    * [x] 21 days moving average
    * [x] exponential moving average
    * [x] momentum
    * [x] Bollinger bands
    * [x] MACD
- [x] LSTM neural network
