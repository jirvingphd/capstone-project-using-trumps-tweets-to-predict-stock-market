- In order to test the effect of Trump's Tweets on the stock market, 
we took each tweet that occured either during market hours, or within 1 day before the market reopened.
- We took the S&P 500 price at the time of the tweet (or closing price for the day if tweeted at night)
and then took the price 60 mins later and calculated the "delta" price, displayed below.
- We then assigned each tweet a 'delta_price_class' of "decrease",'no change", or "increase".
	 - Note: "no change" actually refers to tweets with changes < +/- $0.05.
