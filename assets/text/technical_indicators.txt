1. **7 and 21 day moving averages**
```python
df['ma7'] df['price'].rolling(window = 7 ).mean() #window of 7 if daily data
df['ma21'] df['price'].rolling(window = 21).mean() #window of 21 if daily data
```    
2. **MACD(Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

> Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentumindicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

>The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. 

> Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell - or short - the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.  - _[from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp)_

```python
df['ewma26'] = pd.ewma(df['price'], span=26)
df['ewma12'] = pd.ewma(df['price'], span=12)
df['MACD'] = (df['12ema']-df['26ema'])
```
3. **Exponentially weighted moving average**
```python
dataset['ema'] = dataset['price'].ewm(com=0.5).mean()
```
4. **Bollinger bands**
    > Bollinger Bands® are a popular technical indicators used by traders in all markets, including stocks, futures and currencies. There are a number of uses for Bollinger Bands®, including determining overbought and oversold levels, as a trend following tool, and monitoring for breakouts. There are also some pitfalls of the indicators. In this article, we will address all these areas.
    > Bollinger bands are composed of three lines. One of the more common calculations of Bollinger Bands uses a 20-day simple moving average (SMA) for the middle band. The upper band is calculated by taking the middle band and adding twice the daily standard deviation, the lower band is the same but subtracts twice the daily std. - _[from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/using-bollinger-bands-to-gauge-trends/)_

    - Boilinger Upper Band:<br>
    $BOLU = MA(TP, n) + m * \sigma[TP, n ]$<br><br>
    - Boilinger Lower Band<br>
    $ BOLD = MA(TP,n) - m * \sigma[TP, n ]$
    - Where:
        - $MA$  = moving average
        - $TP$ (typical price) = $(High + Low+Close)/ 3$
        - $n$ is number of days in smoothing period
        - $m$ is the number of standard deviations
        - $\sigma[TP, n]$ = Standard Deviations over last $n$ periods of $TP$

```python
# Create Bollinger Bands
dataset['20sd'] = pd.stats.moments.rolling_std(dataset['price'],20)
dataset['upper_band'] = dataset['ma21'] + (dataset['20sd']*2)
dataset['lower_band'] = dataset['ma21'] - (dataset['20sd']*2)
```

5. **Momentum**
> "Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security's price or volume – that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Simply put, it refers to the rate of change on price movements for a particular asset and is usually defined as a rate. In technical analysis, momentum is considered an oscillator and is used to help identify trend lines." - _[from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/081501.asp)_

    - $ Momentum = V - V_x$
    - Where:
        - $V$ = Latest Price
        - $V_x$ = Closing Price
        - $x$ = number of days ago

```python
# Create Momentum
dataset['momentum'] = dataset['price']-1
```
